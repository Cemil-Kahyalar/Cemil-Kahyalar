 I am interested in .NET C# development, web development, PLC programming, and database management.

Currently, I am learning PLC automation and SCADA systems, while deepening my expertise in .NET C# development.

I am looking to collaborate on projects related to industrial automation, website development, .NET C# development, and educational tools for students.
